THE SNOWMAN TASK:

                                  _===_
                                  (.,.)
                                  ( : )
                                  ( : )
                                  
The leading spaces and the parentheses are always the same for all snowpeople.
The different letters represent sections of the pattern that can individually change.
Each section has exactly four presets for what ASCII characters can fill it.
By mixing and matching these presets for all eight sections, we can make a variety of snowpeople.

                                   HHHHH
                                   HHHHH
                                  X(LNR)Y
                                  X(TTT)Y
                                   (BBB)
